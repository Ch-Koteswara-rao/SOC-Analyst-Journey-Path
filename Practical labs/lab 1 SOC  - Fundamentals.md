 Lab 1: SOC Fundamentals  
**SOC Analyst Journey Path | Practical Labs**

---

##  Overview
This TryHackMe room focuses on understanding the **Security Operations Center (SOC)**, its responsibilities, and how it operates to detect and respond to security incidents.  
The room introduces the **core pillars of a SOC** and includes a **practical exercise involving a port scanning alert**, handled from a SOC Level 1 analyst perspective.

##  Lab Details
In this lab, I learned:

- The purpose and responsibilities of a SOC team  
- The primary SOC focus on **Detection and Response**  
- The three pillars of a SOC: **People, Process, and Technology**  
- How SOC teams operate in day-to-day security use cases  
- How a SOC Level 1 analyst investigates a **port scanning alert**

This lab builds foundational knowledge required for entry-level SOC role.

##  Evidence Observed
During the practical exercise, my observations and I these:

➤ Network activity indicating **port scanning was done**  
➤ Multiple connection attempts targeting different ports  
➤ Alert generated due to suspicious reconnaissance activity  
➤ SOC alert classified under detection use cases  

This behavior is commonly associated with **reconnaissance before an attack**.

---

##  Analysis
Port scanning is typically an early-stage attack technique used to identify open services and vulnerabilities.  
The SOC detected this activity through continuous monitoring and alert correlation.

Analysis confirmed:
- Repeated connection attempts from a single source  
- Access attempts across multiple ports  
- Behavior consistent with reconnaissance activity  

This required further attention to prevent potential exploitation.

## Decisions Made
Based on the analysis:

➤ The alert was treated as a **valid security event**  
➤ The activity was identified as **port scanning**  
➤ Proper SOC procedures were followed for detection 
➤ The incident was documented according to SOC processes  

These actions align with standard SOC Level 1 responsibilities.

---

##  Conclusion
This room helped me understand the **fundamentals of a Security Operations Center** and how SOC teams operate.  
I learned how **People, Process, and Technology** work together to detect and respond to incidents.

The hands-on exercise provided practical experience in identifying and analyzing a **port scanning alert** as a SOC Level 1 analyst.

##  Outcomes Learned
After completing this lab, I am able to:

➤ Explain the purpose and responsibilities of a SOC  
➤ Understand SOC focus on detection and response  
➤ Identify the three pillars of a SOC environment  
➤ Recognize and analyze port scanning activity  
➤ Apply SOC Level 1 workflows in real-world scenarios
