# ⛓️ Attack Chain 

The attack chain represents the sequence of events showing how a attacker gains access, executes activity, and progresses within a system. It helps identify the entry point, trace execution flow, and determine whether compromise has occurred.

Attack chains can begin through multiple entry points such as phishing, credential compromise, or malicious file execution.

---

## 🎯 Initial Access

Initial access is the stage where the attacker first interacts with the system.

Common entry points:

- Phishing link opened by user
- Malicious email attachment executed
- Brute force or unauthorized login
- Execution of downloaded file

Example:

```
User action → Browser → Phishing link opened
```

This represents the starting point of the attack chain.

---

## ⚙️ Process Execution

After gaining access, attackers execute processes to run commands or payloads.

Analyst focus:

- Identify the originating process
- Review parent-child process relationships
- Verify whether execution behavior is expected

Example:

```
winword.exe
 └── powershell.exe
```

This indicates command execution initiated from a document.

---

## 🔗 Process Chain Progression

Attackers often spawn additional processes to continue activity.

Analyst focus:

- Trace process relationships step-by-step
- Identify abnormal execution chains
- Determine whether activity indicates malicious behavior

Example:

```
powershell.exe
 └── cmd.exe
```

This shows continued command execution.

---

## 🌐 Post-Execution Activity

Following execution, additional activity may occur that indicates compromise.

Analyst focus:

- Identify continued process activity
- Detect abnormal execution patterns
- Determine whether escalation is required

Example:

```
powershell.exe
 └── external connection initiated
```

This indicates suspicious activity following execution.

---

## 🧭 Complete Attack Chain Example

```
User opens phishing email
 └── winword.exe
      └── powershell.exe
           └── cmd.exe
                └── external connection
```

This sequence shows the progression from initial access to confirmed suspicious activity.
