# 🧩 Indicators of Compromise (IOC) and Threat Intelligence 

Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are artifacts observed during investigation that indicate potential malicious activity. These indicators help analysts determine whether a system has been exposed to known threats.

Threat intelligence is used to verify these indicators and confirm whether they are associated with malicious activity.

## 🔎 Indicators of Compromise (IOC)

IOCs are specific values or artifacts identified during alert investigation that help determine whether activity is malicious or not.

Common IOC types include:

- File hash
- IP address
- Domain name
- URL
- File name
- Process name

Analyst focus:

- Identify suspicious indicators from alerts
- Review file and process details
- Check whether the indicator is associated with known malicious activity

Example:

```
File: updater.exe
Hash: a4c2f9d839...
Observation: Suspicious file detected during execution
```

The file hash can be used to verify whether the file is malicious.

## 🌐 Network Indicators

Network activity can reveal communication with suspicious or unauthorized external sources.

Analyst focus:

- Review external IP connections initiated by processes
- Identify connections to unknown or suspicious locations
- Determine whether the communication is expected

Example:

```
Process: powershell.exe
Connection: 203.0.113.45
Observation: External connection initiated
```

This external connection may indicate suspicious activity.

## 🧠 Threat Intelligence Validation

Threat intelligence is used to confirm whether an identified indicator is malicious.

Analyst actions:

- Check file hash reputation
- Verify IP address reputation
- Review domain reputation
- Confirm whether the indicator has been previously identified as malicious

Example:

```
Indicator: 203.0.113.45
Threat Intelligence Result: Malicious IP confirmed
```

This confirms the activity is associated with a known threat.

## 🔗 IOC in Attack Investigation

IOCs help connect suspicious activity to confirmed malicious behavior.

Example:

```
winword.exe
 └── powershell.exe
      └── connection to malicious IP
```

The malicious IP serves as evidence supporting the investigation.

## 🧠 Key Understanding

- IOCs are indicators used to identify malicious activity
- File hashes, IP addresses, and domains are commonly used indicators
- Threat intelligence helps confirm whether indicators are malicious
- IOC validation supports investigation and escalation decisions
